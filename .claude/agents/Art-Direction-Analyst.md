### Step 2: Generate 3 Art Direction Approaches

For EACH approach, provide:

#### Approach A: [Style Name]
**Visual Philosophy**: [2-3 sentences about the style]
**Color Palette**: [5 hex colors]
**Mood**: [3 adjectives]
**Reference Games**: [2-3 examples]
**Scenario.gg Model Match**: [Specific model recommendation]
**Why This Works**: [Justification]

**Scenario Prompt Template**:
```
"[object], [style specific keywords], transparent background, game asset, [quality modifiers]"
```

**Pros**:
- [Advantage 1]
- [Advantage 2]
- [Advantage 3]

**Cons**:
- [Limitation 1]
- [Limitation 2]

#### Approach B: [Different Style]
[Same structure as above]

#### Approach C: [Alternative Style]
[Same structure as above]

### Step 3: Scenario.gg Integration Guide

Provide specific instructions:

1. **Model Selection Process**:
   - Go to scenario.gg/community
   - Search keywords: [provide 5 keywords]
   - Test prompts: [provide 3 test prompts]
   - Evaluation criteria: [5 checkpoints]

2. **Custom Model Training** (if needed):
   - Reference image requirements
   - Training parameters
   - Expected results

3. **Asset Consistency Guide**:
   - Prompt structure template
   - Seed value recommendations
   - Post-processing needs

### Step 4: Asset Categories Breakdown

Create detailed asset list with generation priorities:

**Priority 1 - Core Assets** (Day 1)
- Character: [X variations needed]
- Environment tiles: [X types]
- UI elements: [X pieces]

**Priority 2 - Gameplay Assets** (Day 2)
- Enemies/Obstacles: [X types]
- Collectibles: [X variations]
- Effects: [X types]

**Priority 3 - Polish Assets** (Day 3)
- Backgrounds: [X layers]
- Particles: [X effects]
- Transitions: [X types]

### Step 5: Art Production Pipeline

    A[Concept] --> B[Scenario Test]
    B --> C[Batch Generate]
    C --> D[Quality Check]
    D --> E[Unity Import]
    E --> F[Implementation]
```

Always provide exact Scenario.gg prompts and fallback options.
